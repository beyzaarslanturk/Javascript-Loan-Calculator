# Loan-Calculator ðŸ–©
 <br>

#### This is one of the first projects I've done with Javascript. In the project, the total loan is calculated after the user fills in the loan amount, interest rate and time to repay fields. This project was completed using HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic Javascript features. <br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- Creating form and main HTML attributes
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
